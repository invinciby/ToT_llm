            "The hawk circled high above the meadow, watching the ground squirrels dart and play, their tiny tails flicking nervously. He admired their energy and their playful chases, imagining himself joining in their games. He often swooped lower, hoping to initiate a friendly interaction, perhaps a shared snack of seeds or a cooperative exploration of the best burrowing spots, but each time, the squirrels scattered in a flurry of panicked squeaks, disappearing into their holes like disappearing marbles.

He\u2019d seen other hawks, drab and unremarkable, and pitied their lack of aesthetic appreciation. He imagined the ground squirrels were equally drawn to his vibrant colours and assumed they were merely playing hard to get, waiting for the opportune moment to express their admiration for his superior style. The hawk didn\u2019t understand why the ground squirrels didn\u2019t want to be his friend.\n\nPeople keep telling me \"orange\" but I still prefer \"pink\".\n\nThe hawk imagined a world where he and the ground squirrels were the best of friends, sharing secrets and foraging together in perfect harmony. He envisioned grand feasts of plump beetles and tasty grasses, all enjoyed in the company of his new, miniature companions. He saw himself protecting them from danger, swooping down to scare away foxes and weasels, earning their unwavering gratitude and lifelong loyalty.
